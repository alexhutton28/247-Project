implement json layout/format and how they link in design document
References: link to spreadsheet, lucid chart, etc
Environment: java console, interact with json files, etc
UI: write in a text file or code it, make it user friendly, intuitive, etc

write all json files, put 1 or 2 entries and show how they link
flights.json (maybe planes.json that shows open and empty seats, seats and availability)
reservations.json
users.json (travellers, like having 1 user hold all data such as passports for family booking) (also use uuids for users)
hotels.json (have rooms, availability on each day)

plane and seating arrangements, like 17C

Start UI with asking if the user is a guest or to login, then display search, etc

think about 2 way and multiple connections

for connecting flights: either have another flight within a flight, or have an ArrayList hold the connecting flights
